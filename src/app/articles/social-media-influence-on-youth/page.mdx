Lately, a recurring trend on social media has prompted me to reflect on the future of young people. In an era where short-form content dominates, influencers are selling the dream of "getting rich quick" to the youth. Their advice often boils down to the same message: "Work hard, make sacrifices, and somehow make money." However, these oversimplified tips reduce critical life decisions to mere shortcuts and foster a dangerous mindset.

Especially during exam season, students preparing for university are bombarded with messages like, "College isn't that important," or "AI will take over jobs anyway." Many individuals who have gained popularity on social media, often without sufficient knowledge or expertise, are steering young people in this direction. I believe this approach poses serious risks for society.

## University Is More Than a Career Path

University isn't just a building you attend to secure a well-paying job. It's a place where you meet people from diverse backgrounds, encounter different cultures and lifestyles, and engage with professors who broaden your horizons. The events, discussions, and campus environment help you become a more cultured, inquisitive, and open-minded individual. Yet, in today's world, where many are solely focused on making money, the value of being "cultured" is often overlooked.

For instance, when people see a man with an attractive woman, they often assume, "He must be rich." The idea that he might have charmed her with his knowledge, cultural depth, or personal experiences rarely crosses their minds. A significant portion of the population, particularly young men, grows up with the equation "money = success" or "money = happiness." This mindset makes it harder to value others' emotions, practice empathy, or build meaningful relationships. Why? Because the influencers they follow on social media preach, "Just make money, and everything else will fall into place."

## The Allure of Easy Advice

The reason influencers are so effective is that their messages are simple and instant. "Make a lot of money, and everything will work out," resonates with young people, encouraging them to keep consuming such content. On the other hand, advice like, "Read books, travel to gain new perspectives, invest in self-growth," requires time and effort, so it's less appealing. This dynamic pushes young people to prioritize short-term gains over long-term personal development.

## A Concern for Society's Future

I worry that this trend is detrimental to the health of our society. A money-driven lifestyle overshadows empathy, cultural richness, and critical thinking. We need to teach young people to value not just financial success but also personal growth, human connections, and diverse perspectives.

I could write much more on this topic, but for now, I wanted to share these thoughts. We must continue questioning the impact of social media on the youth and strive for a more conscious society.
